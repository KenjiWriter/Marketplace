## Project status
The project is fully working, it needs some light corrections, but it is a good starting point to create something. Unfortunately I abandoned the project due to lack of time for front-end, I am not interested in it, but if someone wants to do front-end I am willing to continue the project as back-end developer :) You can reach me via e-mail: maciej.wisniewski@aol.com
